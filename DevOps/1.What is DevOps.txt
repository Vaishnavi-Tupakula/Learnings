==> Why DevOps?
To speed up the software delivery.

Example: Let's consider 2 famous E-commerce platforms. A phone costs 10k in both 
         the platforms but the 1st one delivers the product in 2 days and the other
         delivers in 5 days. We, as customers choose to buy it from 1st platform 
         right?

         So, it's important to deliver the software application as soon as possible.


==> Why is there a delay in Software product delivery?
To deliver a software application, we have 2 different teams working. 
1) Development team
2) Operations team

**Development team**
This team does
-> Planning=Plans the project flow, resources needed, etc..
-> Coding=Developers actually Code the application in any of the languages like java
-> Building=Combines the code with it's dependencies.
-> Testing=Tests if the code works fine and fulfills all the features and functionalities.

**Operations team**
This team
-> Deployment=Installing the application code 
-> Operations
-> Monitoring
